# WWW 2025 Competition: SmartMem

This challenge is a part of [The Web Conference 2025](https://www2025.thewebconf.org/accepted-competitions).

Uncorrectable Errors (UEs) of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) have been identified as a major failure cause in data
centers. The multi-bit UE failure of High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) highly threatens the availability and reliability of
servers and entire computing clusters. Forecasting UEs before enacting preemptive maintenance measures has emerged as a
viable strategy for diminishing server outages. Some machine-learning based solutions have also been proposed.

However, the UEs prediction presents several challenges: data noise and extreme imbalance as the UEs are exceedingly
rare in memory events; heterogeneous data sources as the DRAMs in the field come from different manufacturing or
architecture platforms; distribution shifts due to hardware aging; and latent factors due to the dynamic access
mechanism.

We cure a real-world memory error dataset that contains both micro and bit information and present a two-stage challenge
for more efficient and generalized event prediction solutions. We believe the competition will provide a breeding ground
to foster discussions and further progress on several important research topics towards real-world ML applications.
