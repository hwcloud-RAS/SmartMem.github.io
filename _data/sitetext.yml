    title: Competition Overview
    body: "In ever-growing datacenters, millions of servers operate
together to meet the rising demand for cloud computing,
big data storage, and AI computing tasks. With numerous
tasks including resource-intensive AI computations running
on these servers, hardware failures significantly impact the
serversâ€™ Reliability, Availability and Serviceability (RAS).
 In this tutorial, we explore cutting-edge methodologies for
predicting hardware failures in cloud environments to ensure
uninterrupted service continuity and optimal performance."

    title1: Background
    text1: "
    Uncorrectable Errors (UEs) of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) have been identified as a major failure cause in data centers. The multi-bit UE failure of High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) highly threatens the availability and reliability of servers and entire computing clusters. Forecasting UEs before enacting preemptive maintenance measures has emerged as a viable strategy for diminishing server outages. Some machine-learning based solutions have also been proposed.

    However, the UEs prediction presents several challenges: data noise and extreme imbalance as the UEs are exceedingly rare in memory events; heterogeneous data sources as the DRAMs in the field come from different manufacturing or architecture platforms; distribution shifts due to hardware aging; and latent factors due to the dynamic access mechanism.
    
    We cure a real-world memory error dataset that contains both micro and bit information and present a two-stage challenge for more efficient and generalized event prediction solutions. We believe the competition will provide a breeding ground to foster discussions and further progress on several important research topics towards real-world ML applications.

    title: Target
    body: "The tutorial targets for researchers and engineers in the field
of system reliability and machine learning. The participants
are expected to have a basic understanding of computer
architecture, hardware errors and machine learning. If not, we
also provide intuitive descriptions for interested participants
during the tutorial. Anyone excited about ML for system is
welcome. The expected audience size is around 50 to 150. No
special technical equipment is needed and some way of taking
notes is suggested."
