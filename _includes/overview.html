                        This competition focuses on predicting Uncorrectable Errors (UEs) in <a

                        random-access memory(DRAM)</a>, a critical issue impacting data center reliability and cloud
                        service
                        availability.
                        As data centers expand to meet the growing demands of cloud computing and web-based
                        applications,
                        hardware failures, particularly memory failures, have become a significant threat to server
                        reliability and uptime. Participants will tackle challenges such as data noise, extreme class
                        imbalance, heterogeneous data sources, and hardware aging, using a real-world dataset containing
                        memory system configurations, error logs, and failure tags. The goal is to develop efficient and
                        generalized solutions for UE prediction, fostering advancements in machine learning applications
                        for web-centric and cloud environments, ultimately enhancing the reliability and resilience of
                        modern data centers.

                        Uncorrectable Errors (UEs) of <a

                        random-access memory (DRAM)</a> have been identified as a
                        major failure cause in data centers. The multi-bit UE failure of <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Bandwidth_Memory" target="_blank">High Bandwidth
                        Memory (HBM)</a> poses a significant threat to the availability and reliability
                        of servers and entire computing clusters.
                        Forecasting UEs before enacting preemptive maintenance measures has emerged as a viable strategy
                        for diminishing server outages. Several machine-learning based solutions have also been
                        proposed.

                    <p>
                        However, predicting UEs presents several challenges: data noise and extreme class imbalance, as
                        UEs are exceptionally rare in memory events; heterogeneous data sources, since DRAMs in
                        operational environments originate from diverse manufacturing or architectural platforms;
                        distribution shifts caused by hardware aging; and latent factors introduced by the dynamic
                        access mechanisms of memory.

                        We cure a real-world memory error dataset that contains both micro-level and bit-level
                        information and
                        present a two-stage challenge for more efficient and generalizable event prediction solutions.
                        We believe the competition will serve as a fertile ground for fostering discussions and
                        advancing
                        research on several important research topics towards real-world ML applications.
