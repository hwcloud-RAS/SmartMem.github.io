                        Our goal is to predict whether each DRAM will experience an Uncorrectable Error (UE) failure
                        within the next \( k \) days. Thus, the problem is formulated as a binary classification
                        problem. The evaluation protocol, as illustrated in Figure 3, is designed based on production
                        requirements. Specifically, at the current time \( t \), an algorithm observes historical data
                        from an observation window \( \Delta t_d \) to predict failures within the prediction interval
                        \([t + \Delta t_l, t + \Delta t_l + \Delta t_p]\), where \( \Delta t_l \) is the minimum time
                        interval between the prediction (i.e., lead time) and the failure, and \( \Delta t_p \) denotes
                        the prediction interval. For evaluation, the lead prediction window is fixed to 15 minutes (\(
                        \Delta t_l \)), and the prediction window is set to 7 days (\( \Delta t_p \)). However,
                        participants are free to explore the observation window and labeling methods for training.
